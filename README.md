# Hanko Nuxt Starter

This repo demonstrates how to integrate Hanko with Nuxt application for authentication and user management.

Hanko is an open-source authentication and user management solution with a focus on moving the login beyond passwords while being 100% deployable today.

- Built for [passkeys](https://www.passkeys.io) as introduced by Apple, Google, and Microsoft
- Fast integration with Hanko Elements web components (login box and user profile)
- API-first, small footprint, cloud-native

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed (version 20.0.0 or later)
- Hanko API URL from [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io/)

> **Note:**
> You'll need to create a Authentication Project on Hanko Cloud with the App URL `http://localhost:3000`. See our docs to learn how to setup a [auth project](https://docs.hanko.io/setup-hanko-cloud).

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko-nuxt-starter.git
```

2. Set up environment variables

   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```sh
    NUXT_PUBLIC_HANKO_API_URL=your-hanko-api-url
    ```

   * Replace `your-hanko-api-url` with your actual Hanko API URL.

1. Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g., `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`). For this project, we've used `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   - Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

2. Navigate to login page and experience Hanko Authentication.
